# Getting Started with Create React App

This React application is a way for me to learn the fundamentals of React. It is a simple, one page application that makes a GET request to a weather API and renders the weather data on the screen. A GET request is sent upon page load, and every 5 seconds thereafter. The user can also stop/start the requests using a button.

Usually the `.env` file would be on the gitignore. In this case I am fine pushing these details to gitHub to enable it to run for others.

React has been enjoyable to work with so far and I look forward to learning more about the library.
